# Creational Patterns

Creational patterns help with making your system independent of how its objects are created, composed and represented.

### Abstract Factory 

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Builder

Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.

### Factory Method

Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

### Prototype

Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.

### Singleton Pattern

The intent of the singleton pattern is to ensure that a class only has one instance, and to provide a global point of access to it.
