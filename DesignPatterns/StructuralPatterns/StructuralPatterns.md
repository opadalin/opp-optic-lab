# Structural Patterns

Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

### Adapter

Convert the interface of a class to another interface clients expects. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

### Bridge

Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

### Composite

Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
