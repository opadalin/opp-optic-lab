# AMP 2023

I will use this repository as a central location for collecting and organizing all the ideas and materials related to my project as part of Omegapoint's Academy Masters Program 2023.

## Introduction

For my Academy Master Program, I will focus on design patterns in software solutions and deep dive into the security aspect of some of these patterns. I will explore whether design patterns can help developers, to not only solve common problems, but to do so without introducing security vulnerabilities in their code. By incorporating Secure by Design principles while exploring these patterns I hope to gain insight in how one can argue why design patterns is your first line of defence. (Bergh Johnsson, D., Deogun, D., & Sawano, D. (2019). Secure by Design. Manning.)

As part of Omegapoint’s delivery catalogue I aim to create a catalogue for easily accessible content to be delivered on a larger scale. This catalogue could be used for new customer commitments and existing commitments we have today.

### Background to Design Patterns

The concept of design patterns was first introduced to a larger audience with the book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, published in 1994. The authors aimed to provide good practices for solving common software design problems. By providing a catalog of 23 patterns that could be applied to a variety of software design problems, none of them describing new or unproven designs, they hoped to make software design more accessible, efficient, and effective, and to help developers write better, and more maintainable code.

### What are Design Patterns?

_“One thing expert designers know not to do is to solve every problem from first principles. Rather, they reuse solutions that have worked for them in the past. When they find a good solution, they use it again and again. Such experience is a part of what makes them experts.”_ (Gamma, E., Helm, R., Johnson, R., & Vlissides, J. (1994). Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software. Addison-Wesley.)

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise during software development. A pattern is not a specific code snippet but rather a general solution for addressing a specific problem. One can see it as a blueprint that can be used and customised for specific needs. They help designers reuse successful designs without having to rediscover them.

### Scope of AMP’23

I will scope my work to be applicable for microservices in Azure. The examples will be in .NET C#. This aligns well with my assignment today. This does not mean the catalogue cannot be used in other tech stacks or languages.


### Security principles design patterns embrace

- Loose coupling - 
- Ubiquitous language - A shared language spoken by everyone on the team, including domain experts, to ensure a common understanding.
- DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself - This principle is about semantic constructs and correlates to having a ubiquitous language.
- Immutability - immutable object are safe to share between threads and open up high data availability - an important aspect of denial of service attacks.

## Goals

- Design Patterns as a First Line of Defence Delivery Catalogue
- Create the course “Secure your Design Patterns”
- Blog posts
- OpKoKo talk
- Competence-day presentation
- Presentation on external event

My personal goal is to learn more about design patterns. I want to be the “go-to” person whenever someone wants to talk about design patterns in code. And my main focus will be to create the delivery catalogue.

### Design Patterns as a First Line of Defence Delivery Catalogue

I aim to create a catalogue to be delivered to team commitments that can be used to kick-start a project. My vision is that teams will be able to use this catalogue to create their first proof-of-concept and start building a straw pipe for the customer with flexible templates on how to approach different design problems, and always with Secure by Design principles in mind.

The delivery catalogue will consist of a git repository with a simple microservice architecture. In the repository there will be a solution with examples on how one can approach common design problems with a single or multiple design patterns.

### Create the course “Secure your Design Patterns”

My initial idea is that I as the teacher will act like a product owner and ask for new functionality and then go through with the class on how one can approach these problems with a design pattern. They will then follow my lead and try to solve it the same as I did or with their own solution. In the end of the class, we will discuss the solutions together and see if there are any improvements to be made.

I am not yet sure if the course will be based on the delivery catalogue or the other way around. But in any case, I plan to reuse the material in between the two as much as possible.

### Blog posts

Blog about different patterns and their use cases in a microservice architechture in Azure.

### OpKoKo talk

I would like to prepare a OpKoKo presentation for the autumn talking about something related to my AMP.

### Competence-day presentations

Plan and prepare competence-day presentations.

### Presentation on external event

Swetugg 2024!

## Pitch

### Swedish version

Nya konsulten på uppdraget vill visa vad hon går för. Den nya kunden har höga förväntningar. I ett nytt åtagande är det viktigt att leverera värde från start. Vi på Omegapoint är experter inom våra områden och med "Design Patterns as a First Line of Defence"-katalogen tar vi hjälp av varandras expertis.

Med katalogen kan vi snabbt bygga upp en anpassningsbar och säker lösning som är baserad på beprövade koncept som vi vet kommer att fungera. Mitt mål är att öka kunskapen inom Omegapoint för design patterns eftersom jag tror det kommer inte bara lyfta bolaget utan även konsulten själv.

### English version

The new consultant on the assignment wants to show what she's capable of. The new customer has high expectations. In a new commitment, it's important to deliver value from the start. At Omegapoint, we are experts in our fields, and with the "Design Patterns as a First Line of Defence"-catalogue, we rely on each other's expertise.

With the catalogue, we can quickly build an adaptable and secure solution based on proven concepts that we know will work. My goal is to increase the knowledge of design patterns within Omegapoint, as I believe it will not only benefit the company, but also the consultant herself.
